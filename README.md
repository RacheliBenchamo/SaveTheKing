# Save The King

## Ahutors : Racheli Benchamo & Yarden Cohen

The game has four players, and the current player can be moved using the arrow keys.
To switch to the next player, press the "P" key. The goal of the game is to bring 
the king to the queen's throne.

Each player has different abilities:
The king can enter a teleport cell and pass over a key without picking it up,
and he can touch the queen's throne to win the game.
The sorceress can extinguish fire, can pass over a key but cannot pick it up.
The warrior can kill orcs, which will leave behind a key, can pass over a key
but cannot pick it up, and can enter the teleport cell.
The thief can steal a key and open a gate, and can also enter the teleport cell.
There are also static objects on the game board, such as a wall, a gate, 
fire, a key, an orc, a teleport cell, and the queen's throne.

The game also features as fairies that move around the board and prevent the player
from reaching the throne and gifts that can help player or not...
